            Now you're ready to get after it. Now you're ready to get after it! The first thing you'll want to do 
            is practice dribbling. Dribbling is the foundation of any basketball game, so spend time getting 
            comfortable bouncing the ball with both hands. Try to keep your head up while dribbling to see the 
            court and plan your next move. Once you feel confident dribbling, it's time to move on to shooting.
            <br><br>
            Find a spot near the hoop and start practicing your shots. Make sure to focus on your formâ€”bend your 
            knees, hold the ball correctly, and follow through with your shooting hand. The more you practice, the 
            better your shooting will get. Don't forget about free throws! Practice them too since they can be 
            game-changers. As you get better, start practicing with your friend. Play one-on-one games to learn how 
            to defend and score against another player. Work on your footwork, positioning, and timing to stay one 
            step ahead of your opponent. Whether you're just shooting around or playing a real game, the key is to 
            have fun and keep practicing. <br><br>
            The more you play, the more you'll improve your skills, and soon you'll 
            be playing like a pro!
