        <h2>Introducing my passion...</h2>
        <p class="A">
            Basketball has been my world for as long as I can remember. It’s not just a game. It’s how I think, compete,
        and push myself every day. Playing for Northeastern’s Men’s Club Basketball team and training six days a 
        week with the women’s practice squad has completely changed my perspective. The women’s team plays with 
        incredible IQ, precision, and effort. Practicing with them has pushed me to improve in ways I never 
        expected. The speed, teamwork, and intensity they bring every day have made me a better player, and the 
        friendships I’ve built with them make it even more rewarding.
        <br><br>
        But I don’t just play. I analyze. I scout opponents, break down plays, and look for small details that make 
        the biggest difference. That same mindset fuels me in business. Just like basketball, success is about 
        preparation, execution, and adjusting on the fly. Growing up moving every few years, I had to adapt to new 
        teams, playing styles, and challenges. That experience shaped how I connect with people and thrive in different 
        environments. 
        <br><br>
        Basketball has given me resilience, leadership, and the ability to perform under pressure. 
        Whether on the court or in life, I’ve learned that success comes to those who put in the work 
        and show up when it matters most.
